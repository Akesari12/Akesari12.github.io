Hello! I am a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley's <a href="https://dlab.berkeley.edu/">Social Science Data Lab (D-Lab)</a> and a JD Candidate at <a href="https://law.yale.edu/">Yale Law School</a>. I recently completed my PhD at <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Law </a>, where I specialized in Law &amp; Economics. At Berkeley, I was a recipient of a <a href="https://dlab.berkeley.edu/">D-Lab</a> Data Science Fellowship, and a research fellowship from the <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/research/leap/">Law, Economics, and Politics Center</a>. I was also a <a href="https://www.google.com/policyfellowship/">Google Policy Fellow</a> at <a href="https://www.engine.is/">Engine</a>, a <a href="https://www.dssgfellowship.org/">Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a> at the University of Chicago, an a Technology Policy Intern at <a href="https://internships.github.com/">GitHub</a>.
<br />
<br />
My primary research interests are in law &amp; technology, data science, and public policy. My current research explores using data science to address questions in privacy and cybercrime law. I am particularly interested in using methods drawn from machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference to explore open empirical questions in U.S. data protection law. I am also interested in integrating data science into empirical legal studies more broadly, and have co-taught a <a href="https://github.com/Akesari12/LS123_Data_Prediction_Law_Spring-2019">Data, Prediction, and Law</a> course for the undergraduate Legal Studies and Data Science programs at Berkeley.
