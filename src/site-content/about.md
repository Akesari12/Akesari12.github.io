I am currently a faculty member at Fordham Law. My primary research interests are in law & technology and law & data science. My work examines artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and privacy, among other topics in tech. Methodologically, I apply methods drawn from machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and causal inference. 

Prior to arriving at Fordham, I held a number of academic positions. I was a postdoctoral research fellow at <a href = "https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili">NYU's Information Law Institute</a>, a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley's <a href = "https://dlab.berkeley.edu/">Social Science Data Lab (D-Lab)</a>, and a visting postdoc at ETH Zurich's <a href = "https://lawecon.ethz.ch/">Center for Law and Economics</a>. I earned my PhD at <a href = "https://www.law.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Law</a>, where I specialized in Law & Economics, JD at <a href = "https://law.yale.edu/">Yale Law School</a>, and BA in Political Science and History from <a href = "https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University - New Brunswick</a>. I was also a <a href = "https://www.google.com/policyfellowship/">Google Policy Fellow</a> at <a href = "https://www.engine.is/">Engine</a>, a <a href = "https://www.dssgfellowship.org/">Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a> at the University of Chicago, and a Technology Policy Intern at <a href = "https://internships.github.com/">GitHub</a>. 

At Fordham, I currently offer 1L Torts, and courses on Law & Technology and Cybersecurity. Previously, I taught or assisted with various undergraduate, law, and graduate courses in both law and data science. I co-taught a <a href = "https://github.com/Akesari12/LS123_Data_Prediction_Law_Spring-2019">Data, Prediction, and Law</a> course for the Berkeley undergraduate Legal Studies and Data Science programs, and a doctoral course in <a href = "https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Computational-Social-Science-Training-Program"> Computational Social Science at Berkeley.</a> I have also taught a number of data science workshops, especially for empirical legal scholars, and co-organized the Conference on Data Science and Law and the Junior Scholars Workshop at the ACM Symposium on Computer Science and Law.
