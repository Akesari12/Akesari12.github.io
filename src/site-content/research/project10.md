Is there a limited supply of good image trademarks? Trademark law long rested on the assumption that there is an inexhaustible supply of good marks that provide businesses with sufficient economic advantages to engage in effective branding. However, this conventional wisdom has recently come under scrutiny as evidence has mounted that the number of effective word marks suffers from both depletion of good marks and congestion of similar marks within certain areas. Leveraging new advances in computational social science, we extend this analysis to the study of image marks. We find that there is little evidence for either congestion or depletion in image marks across the most popular areas, but do see some evidence for registered marks being more complex than unregistered marks.
