In this Article, we aim to study how well these search engines identify potential conflicts under Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1052(d),  which forbids the registration of a trademark that is “confusingly similar” to an existing registered trademark. While a traditional trademark applicant might rely on government-supported techniques (the TESS system) for searching for confusingly similar marks, it turns out that they are often incomplete. Today, because of these various gaps in TESS, several private trademark search engines have emerged to supplement TESS and provide more thorough results. These search engines generally aim to provide a user with a more comprehensive list of potential mark conflicts and recommend whether the user should proceed with their trademark application. Each search engine uses its own methods, algorithms, and techniques to return results. Our study aims to answer the question of which search engines do the best job of returning the most relevant results to a user, and why. We then use our findings to demonstrate how our results potentially affect trademark law by demonstrating the emergence of search costs that are born by the trademark registrant, rather than the consumer.
