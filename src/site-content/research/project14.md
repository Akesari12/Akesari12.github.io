Privacy law and regulation have turned to “consent” as the legitimate basis for collecting and processing individuals’ data. As
governments have rushed to enshrine consent requirements in their
privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA),
significant challenges remain in understanding how these legal
mandates are operationalized in software. The opaque nature of
software development processes further complicates this translation. To address this, we explore the use of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in requirements engineering to bridge the gap between legal
requirements and technical implementation. This study employs a
three-step pipeline that involves using an LLM to classify software
use cases for compliance, generating LLM modifications for noncompliant cases, and manually validating these changes against
legal standards. Our preliminary findings highlight the potential of
LLMs in automating compliance tasks, while also revealing limitations in their reasoning capabilities. By benchmarking LLMs against
real-world use cases, this research provides insights into leveraging
AI-driven solutions to enhance legal compliance of software.
