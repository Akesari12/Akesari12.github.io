In the 2010s, the open government data movement—a confluence of government transparency and
open source advocacy—succeeded in making most federal data disclosed by default and free of
restriction on downstream use. However, keen-eyed observers noted a “new ambiguity” in open
government data policies. It was not clear if the appropriate focus of these policies was
government—in the sense of accountability and transparency—or data—in the sense of
downstream use and reuse of government datasets by public and private actors. Even as federal
government data policies moved from Executive Branch prerogative to statutory mandate, that
ambiguity remained unresolved. But the rise of artificial intelligence—and its accompanying
demand for new data sources—tipped the scale in favor of data.

This Article does not seek to resolve the ambiguity in the other direction or rebalance the scales.
Instead, this Article articulates how open government principles have a role to play even when
federal open data are viewed primarily as an asset or resource to build, train, and test artificial
intelligence systems. Further, that role may require refinements in how we think about the “open”
part of open government data. There are compelling reasons to condition certain reuses of federal
open data on the disclosure of the use even if that would make the use of that data less “open” in
some senses.
