How is technology changing law and legal practice? This survey course explores the intersection of law and various forms of technology, including but not limited to the internet, blockchain, and artificial intelligence. This course will cover both substantive debates in law and tech (How effectively do websites implement CCPA and GDPR privacy requirements? How should we regulate cybersecurity risk?) and the ways new technology is transforming legal practice (Will ChatGPT automate legal writing? Are smart contracts really contracts?).
