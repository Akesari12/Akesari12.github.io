Cybersecurity is a rapidly growing area of the economy - the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the number of new cybersecurity jobs will grow by over 30\% over the next decade, as compared to just 3\% on average for jobs in other sectors. Law firms are creating specialized privacy and cybersecurity practice groups, and regulators at the state and federal level are devoting substantial resources to cybersecurity standards and enforcement. Cybersecurity has become so pressing because it increasingly penetrates nearly all aspects of the human experience.

This course provides an introduction to the theories, legal background, and technical skills necessary to build a career in cybersecurity. At a high level, we will aim to understand the incentives of both attackers and defenders, the tools used to compromise data and the ones used to secure it, and the regulatory frameworks that shape cybersecurity in practice. Cybersecurity is an inherently interdisciplinary topic and we will draw on the social sciences, computer science, and law to tackle it.

In terms of pedagogical approach, this course will be heavily ``hands-on'' with only minimal lecturing. Part of the course will include a computer lab component. These labs will introduce some of the basic technical jargon and concepts necessary for ``doing'' cybersecurity. These computer exercises will be accompanied by hands-on modules exploring the legal and ethical implications of the technical aspects of cybersecurity. There are no prerequisites for this course and I assume nor require any previous technical experience - the labs should be accessible to anyone regardless of prior experience!
