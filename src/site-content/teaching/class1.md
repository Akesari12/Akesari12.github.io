This is a two-semester course that provides a rigorous introduction to methods and tools in advanced data analytics for social science doctoral students. It was developed as the required course for Berkeley's <a href = "https://bids.berkeley.edu/research/computational-social-science-training-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computational Social Science Training Program</a>. The goal of the course is toprovide students with a strong foundation of knowledge of core methods, thereby preparing them to contribute to research teams, to conduct their own research, and to enroll in more advanced courses. The course will cover research reproducibility, machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference. The course is divided into modules, each lasting 3-5 weeks. Each module will include lectures, discussion ofexample research articles, lab exercises, and a group project involving Python or R programming. Projects, typically done in groups of 3 students, will also provide the opportunity to practice reproducibility techniques, data manipulation and transformation, and data science workflows.
