There is extensive literature that explores the causes of cybercrime, but relatively little work that aims to predict future incidents. In 2011, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  provided guidelines for how publicly traded companies should convey these risks to potential investors. The SEC and other regulatory agencies are exploring how to leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science tools to improve their regulatory efforts. This paper explores the potential to use machine learning and natural language processing techniques to analyze firms' mandatory risk disclosure statements, and predict which firms are at the greatest risk of suffering cybersecurity incidents. More broadly, this study highlights the potential for using legally mandated disclosures to bolster regulatory efforts, particularly in the context of prediction policy problems.</p>","id":"615d1964-55a5-5690-a54f-892514696973"},{"frontmatter":{"collab":null,"date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","publication":"working paper...","title":"The Effect of State Data Breach Notification Laws on Medical Identity Theft","url_external":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3700248","youtube":null,"youtube_alt":null,"thumb":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.0408163265306123,"src":"/static/777e3522ce621757257fc430896ad6fe/09341/Synthetic_Observed_US.jpg","srcSet":"/static/777e3522ce621757257fc430896ad6fe/f836f/Synthetic_Observed_US.jpg 200w,\n/static/777e3522ce621757257fc430896ad6fe/2244e/Synthetic_Observed_US.jpg 400w,\n/static/777e3522ce621757257fc430896ad6fe/09341/Synthetic_Observed_US.jpg 713w","sizes":"(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px"}}}},"html":"<p>As the number of data breaches in the United States grows each year, cybersecurity has become an increasingly important policy area. The primary mechanism for regulating and deterring data breaches is the \"data breach notification law.\" Every U.S. state now has such a law that mandates that certain organizations disclose data breaches to their data subjects. Despite the popularity of these laws, there is relatively little evidence about their effectiveness at deterring breaches, and therefore reducing identity theft. Using medical identity theft panel data collected from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), this study implements an augmented synthetic control approach to analyze the effect of certain data breach notification standards on medical identity theft.</p>","id":"f837fc75-cd65-5091-87a0-8d3562ca03a7"},{"frontmatter":{"collab":"Jae Yeon Kim","date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","publication":"Journal of Online Trust and Safety","title":"Misinformation and Hate Speech: The Case of Anti-Asian Hate Speech During the COVID-19 Pandemic","url_external":"https://tsjournal.org/index.php/jots/article/view/13/5","youtube":"https://youtu.be/mlCQJba3SVc","youtube_alt":"Journal of Online Trust and Safety Inaugural Issue Webinar","thumb":null},"html":"<p>Donald Trump linked COVID-19 to Chinese people on March 16, 2020, by calling it the Chinese virus.

Trump increased the prevalence of both anti-Asian hate speech and counterhate speech. In addition, there is a linkage between hate speech and misinformation. Both before and after Trump’s tweet, hate speech speakers shared misinformation regarding the role of the Chinese government in the origin and spread of COVID-19. However, this tendency was amplified in the post-Trump tweet period. The literature on misinformation and hate speech has been developed in parallel, yet misinformation and hate speech are often interwoven in practice.

While a traditional trademark applicant might rely on government-supported techniques (the TESS system) for searching for confusingly similar marks, it turns out that they are often incomplete. Today, because of these various gaps in TESS, several private trademark search engines have emerged to supplement TESS and provide more thorough results. These search engines generally aim to provide a user with a more comprehensive list of potential mark conflicts and recommend whether the user should proceed with their trademark application. Each search engine uses its own methods, algorithms, and techniques to return results. Our study aims to answer the question of which search engines do the best job of returning the most relevant results to a user, and why. We then use our findings to demonstrate how our results potentially affect trademark law by demonstrating the emergence of search costs that are born by the trademark registrant, rather than the consumer.</p>","id":"c83cd01d-df5e-59bd-9f7f-a5d54f2bc97c"},{"frontmatter":{"collab":"Joao Caldeira, Alex Fout, and Raesetje Sefala et. al.","date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","publication":"Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) AI For Social Good Workshop","title":"Improving Traffic Safety Through Video Analysis in Jakarta, Indonesia","url_external":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01106","youtube":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiUb2Oy79Rg","youtube_alt":"NeurIPS 2018 AI For Social Good Workshop","thumb":null},"html":"<p>This project presents the results of a partnership between the Data Science for Social Good fellowship, Jakarta Smart City and Pulse Lab Jakarta to create a video analysis pipeline for the purpose of improving traffic safety in Jakarta.

What will ongoing service cost? Is it compatible\nwith other devices you use? Can you move data and applications across devices? Can you switch providers?

As sellers blend hardware and software—as well as product\nand service—tethers yoke the consumer to a continuous post-transaction relationship with the seller. The consequences of that dynamic will be felt both at\nthe level of individual consumer harms and on the scale of broader, economywide effects.

Just like licit businesses, illicit firms rely on intermediaries to advertise, sell and deliver products, collect payments, and maintain a reputation. Recognizing these needs, law enforcers use the courts, administrative procedures, and self–regulatory frameworks to execute a deterrence by denial strategy. Enforcers of the law seize the financial rewards and infrastructures necessary for the operation of illicit firms to deter their presence.</p>\n<p>Policing illicit actors through their intermediaries raises due process and fairness concerns because service–providing companies may not be aware of the criminal activity, and because enforcement actions have consequences for consumers and other, licit firms. Yet, achieving direct deterrence by punishment suffers from jurisdictional and resource constraints, leaving enforcers with few other options for remedy. This Article integrates literature from the computer science and legal fields to explain enforcers’ interventions, explore their efficacy, and evaluate the merits and demerits of enforcement efforts focused on the intermediaries used by financially–motivated cybercriminals.</p>","id":"7cb234d9-63e2-5f33-ad02-14a7434136db"}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
