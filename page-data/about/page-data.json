My primary research interests are in privacy and cybersecurity law, data science, and public policy. I am particularly interested in using methods drawn from machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference to explore open questions in law and technology. I also have a number of projects that integrate data science methods into empirical legal studies more broadly.</p>\n<p>Prior to arriving at Fordham, I held a number of academic positions. I was a postdoctoral research fellow at <a href = \"https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili\">NYU's Information Law Institute</a>, a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley's <a href = \"https://dlab.berkeley.edu/\">Social Science Data Lab (D-Lab)</a>, and a visting postdoc at ETH Zurich's <a href = \"https://lawecon.ethz.ch/\">Center for Law and Economics</a>. I earned my PhD at <a href = \"https://www.law.berkeley.edu/\">Berkeley Law</a>, where I specialized in Law &#x26; Economics, JD at <a href = \"https://law.yale.edu/\">Yale Law School</a>, and BA in Political Science and History from <a href = \"https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/\">Rutgers University - New Brunswick</a>.

I co-taught a <a href = \"https://github.com/Akesari12/LS123_Data_Prediction_Law_Spring-2019\">Data, Prediction, and Law</a> course for the Berkeley undergraduate Legal Studies and Data Science programs, and a doctoral course in <a href = \"https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Computational-Social-Science-Training-Program\"> Computational Social Science at Berkeley.</a></p>\n<p>For more details, please see my <a href=\"https://github.com/Akesari12/Akesari12.github.io/raw/dev/Aniket_Kesari_CV.pdf\" download=\"Aniket Kesari CV\">CV <img id=\"pdftag\" src='/Adobe-PDF-icon.png'></a>.</p>","id":"0e22dacf-379e-50d9-91e9-eb5cf706416d"}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
