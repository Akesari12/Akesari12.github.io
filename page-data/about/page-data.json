I earned my PhD at <a href = \"https://www.law.berkeley.edu/\">Berkeley Law</a>, where I specialized in Law &#x26; Economics, JD at <a href = \"https://law.yale.edu/\">Yale Law School</a>, and BA in Political Science and History from <a href = \"https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/\">Rutgers University - New Brunswick</a>. During graduate school, I was a recipient of a <a href = \"https://dlab.berkeley.edu/\">D-Lab</a> Data Science Fellowship, and a research fellowship from the <a href = \"https://www.law.berkeley.edu/research/leap/\">Law, Economics, and Politics Center</a>. I was also a <a href = \"https://www.google.com/policyfellowship/\">Google Policy Fellow</a> at <a href = \"https://www.engine.is/\">Engine</a>, a <a href = \"https://www.dssgfellowship.org/\">Data Science for Social Good Fellow</a> at the University of Chicago, and a Technology Policy Intern at <a href = \"https://internships.github.com/\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>My primary research interests are in privacy and cybercrime law, data science, and public policy. I am particularly interested in using methods drawn from machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference to explore open empirical questions in U.S. data protection law. I am also interested in integrating data science into empirical legal studies more broadly, and have co-taught a <a href = \"https://github.com/Akesari12/LS123_Data_Prediction_Law_Spring-2019\">Data, Prediction, and Law</a> course for the undergraduate Legal Studies and Data Science programs, and a graduate course in <a href = \"https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Computational-Social-Science-Training-Program\"> Computational Social Science at Berkeley.</a></p>\n<p>For more details, please see my <a href=\"https://github.com/Akesari12/Akesari12.github.io/raw/dev/Aniket_Kesari_CV.pdf\" download=\"Aniket Kesari CV\">CV</a>. I'm on the academic job market this year, and you can find me at the American Law and Economics Association annual meeting, Intellectual Property Scholars Conference, Cybersecurity Law and Policy Scholars Conference, ACM Symposium on Law and Computer Science, and Conference on Empirical Legal Studies.</p>","id":"0e22dacf-379e-50d9-91e9-eb5cf706416d"}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
